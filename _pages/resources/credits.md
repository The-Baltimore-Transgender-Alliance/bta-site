This document was originally created as part of the Facebook group Bmore âš§ Trans, and is primarily managed by PK (they/them), who can be contacted at pkkimkowalewski@gmail.com.

It was compiled with considerable help from existing resource lists provided by Evan Lori Mahone, The Baltimore Transgender Alliance, Star Track, and Elliott Gillooly, as well as contributions from community members and leaders.

Feel free to contact PK with any questions, feedback, comments, corrections, and recommendations/submissions! We could especially use information about university resources at this time!
