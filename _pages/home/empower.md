We can build support networks & family for ourselves that allow for self maintaining community. We can help each other --we can help ourselves! We house, educate, & support one another as we give power to the new generation. Our movement is getting younger & more radical & still we are interfacing with power brokers in our city. We are becoming those power brokers. Our conscience in sharing that power with each other is lethal to the forces that make our lives more difficult.
