# History
Years of organizing and labor of our elders brought Baltimore to an awareness of the value of our transgender residents in 2014. Yet it was the loss of Mia Henderson and Kandy Hall that summer, which clarified that Baltimore needed a formation of transgender leaders that could call together the many trans led organizations of the city in coalition beyond the purview of larger LGBT community organizations. Under the leadership of Bryanna Jenkins, Monica Yorkman and Ken Jiretsu, Baltimoreâ€™s transgender communities united and formed The Baltimore Transgender Alliance.

This family of organizations, activists, and community members is an autonomous transgender sanctuary that is a conduit for the power of our community members to energize the Movement for Trans Lives in our city.
# Mission
Our mission is to Unify, Reclaim, and Empower the transgender communities of Baltimore City.

#### Unify
We must come together in Unity if we want to that we can heal together collectively. We must bridge our divides of ability, race, class, language, and identity such that we can truly build our communities with comprehensive solidarity. Our diversity makes us powerful.

#### Reclaim
We must Reclaim our stories and overwhelm the mainstream with accounts of trans experience, beauty, and power. --writing, speaking, and shouting our own stories we can portray ourselves with the complexity we deserve as fully realized human beings. We must teach others to see, not just to see our gender, but also our humanity.

#### Empower
We must empower ourselves. We can build support and family networks that allow us to have a self maintaining community. We can help each other --we can help ourselves! We house, educate, and support one another as we give power to the new generation. Our movement is getting younger and more radical and still we are interfacing with power brokers in our city. We are becoming those power brokers. Our conscience in sharing that power with each other is lethal to the forces that make our lives more difficult.

# Structure
We are a parallel platform of leaders from other transgender led projects. We operate on consensus and understand that we must not replicate the systems of marginalization that we seek to oppose. We function, in part, as a project that can be used by all as an organizing tool to energize other projects. But also as an incubator for anything that improves the lives of Baltimore's transgender population.

Come talk with us about how we can work together to empower our community!
