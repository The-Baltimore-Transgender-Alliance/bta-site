A continuously growing closet of garments housed in our offices at the GLCCB, the clothes travel with us to events and are available in our office during our open hours.

Many​ ​trans​ ​individuals​ ​understandably​ ​have​ ​trouble​ ​find​ ​affirming​ ​clothing​ ​--unfamiliar​ ​sizing,
lack​ ​of​ ​support​ ​and​ ​expensive​ ​price tags​ ​can​ ​keep​ ​people​ ​from​ ​the​ ​clothes​ ​they​ ​need​ ​to​ ​affirm​ ​their identity.​ ​The​ ​clothing​ ​closet​ ​is​ ​more​ ​than​ ​a​ ​collection​ ​of​ ​fabric.​ ​It​ ​is​ ​an​ ​opportunity​ ​to​ ​understand and​ ​affirmed​ ​within​ ​one’s identity.
