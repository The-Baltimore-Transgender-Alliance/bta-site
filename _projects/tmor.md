name: Trans March of Resilience
---
We organize, in coalition with the many trans-led groups of our city, a march of resilience. In the African tradition of honoring the lives of those lost through celebration and stories of life, we march in unity. Originating in few cities and now spanning to dozens across the nation, we repurpose public space as tools for communication with our city. We march to assert our humanity and value in the larger Baltimore community.
