We populate education workshops tailored to a variety of organizational needs. Largely, this looks like workplace diversity trainings on gender expansive identities and why organizations should do the work to make their workplace a transgender sanctuary.

**Trans 101**

Introductory lectures on transgender terminology with a focus on the equipping participants with tools for further discussion. These workshops are geared towards bringing participants from square one to someone transgender individuals can feel safe interacting with.

**Trans 201**

Taking the origins of gender variance and expansion beyond the introduction, The next level courses unpack the lived experiences of gender as we interface with unaccommodating systems. Further, this workshop explores the connections between binary gender and Eurocentric understandings of biological sex which seeks to erase and control our bodies.

We populate 101 and 201 educational seminars on interacting with our community. These seminars will always be taught by a transgender individual and will always compensate that labor.
