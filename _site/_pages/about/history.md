Years of organizing and labor of our elders brought Baltimore to an awareness of the value of our transgender residents in 2014. Yet it was the loss of Mia Henderson and Kandy Hall that summer, which clarified that Baltimore needed a formation of transgender leaders that could call together the many trans led organizations of the city in coalition beyond the purview of larger LGBT community organizations. Under the leadership of Bryanna Jenkins, Monica Yorkman and Ken Jiretsu, Baltimoreâ€™s transgender communities united and formed The Baltimore Transgender Alliance.

This family of organizations, activists, and community members is an autonomous transgender sanctuary that is a conduit for the power of our community members to energize the Movement for Trans Lives in our city.
