We are elated to hear that Chelsea Manning is free from prison today! Solitary confinement is inhumane and we hope that history remembers the sacrifices that she made and the pain she endured in the name of justice and transparency. With that said, Chelsea is coming out of prison with a large public platform and several thousand dollars raised on her behalf. Most incarcerated trans people won't get that kind of welcome home. No one knows their names, no one fundraises for them, and no one celebrates their release. We hope that Chelsea and everyone who fought so hard to get her out of prison will continue to fight for incarcerated trans people of color who are denied care, sexually assaulted, and put in facilities that don't match their gender in prisons all across this country.
