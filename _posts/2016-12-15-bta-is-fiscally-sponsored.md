We are proud to announce that we are officially fiscally sponsored by Fusion Partnerships, Inc.!
<!--more-->
While we're not a legal 501(c)3 organization, being under Fusion umbrella alongside groups like Power Inside, Hollaback Bmore, and so many more, affords us many of the opportunities and resources that a larger non-profit would have at their disposal. This means that we can get our dream of a transgender housing project off the ground much sooner than we'd anticipated! The growth of our organization is one of the many things we're grateful for this year and we can't wait to see what the future holds! http://fusiongroup.org
