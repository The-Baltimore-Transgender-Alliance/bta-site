Family,

Let's talk about the violence against trans bodies in our city. Rest in Power Alphonza Watson. We will not wait for another life to be taken.

3 years ago, 3 people showed up in the rain for Mia Henderson's vigil. This year 100 of you stayed for almost an hour and a half for Alphonza. We thank you.

Cis people,
It's time for you to stop devaluing us and start seeing us as human. We shop where you shop, eat where you eat, and live where you live. We always have.

We also hurt as you hurt when we lose a sibling.

You won't understand it all over night; keep learning, keep unpacking how you contribute to the oppression of trans people.

We are going to get free. We need you to get out of our way!
