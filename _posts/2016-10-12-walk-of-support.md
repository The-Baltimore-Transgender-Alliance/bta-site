An event by our member organization, Sistas of the “t”:

On August 12th two African American transgender women outreach workers were out doing harm reduction work, walking along their designated route when they were approached and robbed at gunpoint by two assailants. Ironically, ”The Stroll” where they work is crawling with police officers who that night were no more than 2-3 blocks away from the assault. When the two women approached the police to ask for assistance, they were repeatedly rebuffed and misgendered. No action was taken by the police on their behalf.

In response, we are marching in support of the outreach workers. We will walk along “The Stroll”. Come out in your best slutty outfit and walk with us for a great cause.

Walk of Support
October 22nd
7-9pm
Ynot Lot

We also have caps for sale, for the march at 10 dollars each. The money will go to outreach workers.
